# Shortest Path Problem
Project created in my Data Structures and Algorithms class.  
Project was done with the help of Ethan Nix and Krutivas Pradhan.  

Project gets nodes with weight (representing miles) from a text file.  
The program will turn that text file into a graph.  
You can view the graph at any time.  
You are able to select 2 points on the graph and the program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.  
The program then highlights the shortest path red.
